# Binary_classification_ground_truth
#we use spine data from kaggle
#Groundtruth model is a 2 layer DNN that takes spine data and defines the truth (0 or 1) value of the input data
#trained model is a 2 layer DNN that is trained with 1/3 of the data set
#untrained model is a 2 layer DNN that is not trained
