# Binary_classification_ground_truth
#we use two data sets from kaggle. The first contains spine data, and has 310 entries. The second contains cancer data and has ~500 entries
#Groundtruth model is a 2 layer DNN that takes the data and defines the truth (0 or 1) value of the input data. Currently the weights are fixed.
#trained model is a 2 layer DNN that is trained with 2/3 of the data set
#untrained model is a 2 layer DNN that is not trained
